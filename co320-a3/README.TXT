A constructor method initializes newly created objects.

Accessor method example: "public String getCID()"(taken from courses source code.)
Accessors also known as a getter and its a method declared as public which returns a value.

Mutator method example: "this.cid = cid;"(taken from courses source code.)
Mutators also known as setter or modifiers which are also declared as public but they do not return any value

5)
To restrict students from only taking a maximum of 5 courses I would use an 'if' statement to check if the student is placed on less than or equal to 5 courses and if he is on 5 or less he/she would be added on the course, otherwise there would be a message saying he/she is on too many courses.
